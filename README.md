# not-netflix

## Project Vision
NotNetflix aims to be a dedicated and streamlined clone of the Netflix movie hosting platform, this recreation will be detailed and faithful to the original website design. The goal is to build a web application where users can explore, search, and watch movie trailers, offering a glimpse into the vast universe of films and shows, as provided by The Movie DB platform.

## MVP
Landing Page: A captivating first impression is crucial. The landing page will feature a selection of movies, categorized into sections like "Popular," genre specific cateogires like "Horror," and "Recently Released." It will serve as the hub for movie enthusiasts to explore new and exciting content.

Movie Cards: Each movie will be represented by a card displaying key detailsâ€”poster, title, and a short synopsis. I'm aiming for a design that's not only visually appealing but also informative, providing a snapshot of the film at a glance.

Search Functionality: A dynamic search feature will allow users to find movies based on titles. It will be intuitive, fast, and capable of handling various user queries, displaying results in a user-friendly format.

Trailer Playback: Integrating a trailer playback feature where users can watch the trailers directly on the site. This will be triggered by a play button.

## PMVP
Main Page Navbar Navegation: Additional pages available to the user as categorized by TV Shows and Movies.

Featured Selection: A randomized featured title to be displayed prominently at the top of the home page, as per the Netflix home page.

Mouseover Playback: Trailer playback will also be configured to respond to mouseover behavior. 

## Development Strategy 

Wireframing: Before diving into code, I have sketched out a detailed wireframe to visualize the site's layout, ensuring a user-friendly and intuitive design. Please view here: https://www.figma.com/file/HeJynlPCxTEniOYpxXVG0L/Not-Netflix?type=design&node-id=0-1&mode=design&t=kQUSNumX8xTmU0ib-0

API Exploration: I'll familiarize myself with The Movie DB API, understanding its endpoints, data structures, and how best to utilize it to fetch the required data.

Frontend and Backend Development: The focus will be on creating a responsive, fast, and immersive user interface while ensuring the backend efficiently handles API requests, data processing, and serves the frontend seamlessly.

Iterative Testing: Regular testing will be integral to the development process, ensuring each feature works perfectly and the user experience is smooth across different devices and browsers.

## Aticipated Challenges

API Limitations: Navigating the limitations and usage quotas of The Movie DB API will be crucial to ensuring the app runs smoothly without hitting any roadblocks.

Responsive Design: Ensuring the app is fully responsive and provides a seamless experience on various devices and screen sizes will be a key focus.

Performance Optimization: Loading times and efficient data handling will be essential, especially when dealing with high volumes of data and media content like movie trailers.
